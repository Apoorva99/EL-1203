### Code reviews

Before sending code reviews, run `bazel test ...` to ensure tests are passing.

Code changes are accepted via [pull request][github].

When approved, the change will be submitted by a team member and automatically
merged into the repository.


### Bug IDs

Some TODOs and NOTEs sprinkled throughout the code have associated IDs of the
form `t/1364`. These correspond to bugs in our internal bug tracker. Eventually
these bugs will be moved to the GitHub Issues, but until then they can simply be
ignored.
